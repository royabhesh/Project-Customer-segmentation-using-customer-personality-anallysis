# Project-Customer-segmentation-using-customer-personality-analysis
Perform clustering to segment customers based on their attributes, which helps the business tailor its products and marketing strategies to the needs of different customer groups.

Here's a concise overview for the Customer Personality Analysis project:

Problem Statement: Customer Personality Analysis involves a detailed examination of a company’s ideal customers to better understand their behaviors, needs, and concerns. This analysis helps businesses customize their products and marketing strategies for different customer segments. By identifying target segments more likely to purchase specific products, companies can focus their marketing efforts more effectively.

Dataset Details: The dataset includes various attributes about customers, products, promotions, and places of purchase:

People: Customer details such as ID, birth year, education level, marital status, income, household details, enrollment date, recency of purchase, and complaints.
Products: Amount spent on various product categories like wine, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold over the last two years.
Promotion: Data on the number of purchases made with discounts and responses to different marketing campaigns.
Place: Information on the number of purchases made through the company’s website, catalog, and stores, as well as website visits.

Business Objective: The objective is to perform clustering to segment customers based on their attributes, which helps the business tailor its products and marketing strategies to the needs of different customer groups.

Algorithms Used:

K-Means Clustering,
Agglomerative Clustering,
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Solution: This is an unsupervised learning project, focusing on clustering the customers into different segments. Applied various clustering algorithms and evaluated them using metrics like the Silhouette Score. Based on the performance, chosed K-Means Clustering for the final model due to its higher silhouette score, indicating well-defined clusters.
